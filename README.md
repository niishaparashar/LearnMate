LearnMate addresses the challenge students face when choosing from countless online courses with little personalized guidance. Acting as an interactive Agentic AI coach, LearnMate chats with students to understand their interests—like Frontend Development, Cybersecurity, or UI/UX Design—and assesses their current skills. It then creates a tailored learning roadmap, selecting the most relevant courses and projects to match each student's goals. As students progress, LearnMate dynamically updates the roadmap based on feedback and evolving interests. This ensures each learner follows a focused, adaptive path, boosting motivation and helping them achieve long-term career success.
